# passwordGenerator_HW3

For this homework I had to create a password generator that allowed the user to choose a password that had the ability to contain three characters types, along with the length of the password.

The code works by first providing the user with a prompt to input the length of their password. If the user input is outside of the allowed length, between 8 and 128, then the user is prompted again to input a length number. After this the user is asked if they would like uppercase, lowercase and/or special characters in their password. If the user says no to the first two alerts, then by default the password will only contain special characters. The code then adds each array of character types into a single array of 'currentPasswordContentArray' for the code to select from when selecting characters to add into the password. The code then runs a for loop with the length of the password input length and for each iteration it selects a random character from the 'currentPasswordContentArray.' Once this is completed the code then looks at each character in the password and counts how many there are of each one. If a character type that was selected is missing then the code is ran again to generate the password. Once the password satisfies all conditions then it is displayed on the screen for the user to see.
